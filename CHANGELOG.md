## [122] - 23.10.2014
### Added

### Fixed
- Fixed translation variables and messages. Note: this change will overwrite ALL previous module translations. See

## 121 - 6.8.2014
### Fixed
- The module now supports PrestaShop up to version 1.6.
- The module now removes quotation marks from product names and description â€“ previously it caused errors in hash calc

- Optional parameters (e.g. pre-selected payment method, buyer's identification code) are now included in the hash calc
when available (currently not available, though, but enabling is possible in further development - see "_construct"
method in MaksuturvaGatewayImplementation.php and Maksuturva Payment interface description).
- Module directory structure updated to enable installation through PrestaShop user interface.
